# DECISIONS.md

Record key product and implementation decisions so later sessions do not lose the reasoning.

## 2026-04-12

### Product scope

- `v0` is CLI only
- distribution is npm-first
- `v0` manages only already-local skills
- `v0` directly modifies the local environment

### Discovery and storage model

- agent discovery uses built-in rules plus user config overrides
- SkillMux storage is anchored at `<user-home>/.skillmux`
- agent directories are always resolved from the user home, not from `skillmuxHome`
- real skill content should be gathered into SkillMux-managed storage

### Command surface for `v0`

- the first command set is:
  - `scan`
  - `list`
  - `import`
  - `enable`
  - `disable`
  - `agents`
  - `doctor`
  - `config`

### Manifest and persistence

- manifest validation is strict at the schema layer
- `readManifest` rejects `skillmuxHome` drift
- manifest writes use unique temp files before rename

### Filesystem safety

- path containment checks must handle Windows drive boundaries explicitly
- filesystem writes must reject symlink or junction ancestors
- SkillMux only removes links, never normal directories, during disable/remove-style flows
- copying into managed storage rejects symlink entries inside the source skill

### Task 6 scan/list behavior

- scan classifies entries into:
  - `managed-link`
  - `unmanaged-directory`
  - `broken-link`
  - `unknown`
- links that point outside the managed store are treated as `unknown`
- broken links are reported as scan issues
- `list` is a live scan projection in `v0`; it does not depend on a separately persisted entry table
